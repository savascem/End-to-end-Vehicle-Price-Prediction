# The work in this folder consists of 3 sub-sections:

1 - Scraping data from cars.com with web scraping

    For this project we scraped more than 23000 data for 20 different car models from cars.com.
    The data was scraped from the related site with beautifulSoup.
    You can find the related codes in the scraping.py file in the scraping folder.


2 - Data processing and Model creation

    We have analysed and processed the data we excavated on cars.com in detail and created many new variables.
    
    As the final model, we preferred the LightGBM model.
    We preferred it because it is a model that can be protected from both working speed and overtraining in large-scale data.

3 - Pipeline

    In this section we integrated our model into a pipeline.
    
    * Run the pipeline.py file in the pipeline folder in command promt.
    * Copy the url address of any vehicle from cars.com and enter it when the model asks you for this input.
    * enter the path to the model.pkl file in the same folder as input.
    * You will display the prediction value of our model on the screen according to the characteristics of the related vehicle.
