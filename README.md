# Description

This project has been prepared as a miuul data science bootcamp final project.

In this project, a machine learning model was trained with data scraped from 25,000 cars obtained through web scraping from cars.com. Afterwards, the trained ML model was integrated into a website using Django, allowing users to enter a link and obtain a price estimation for the corresponding vehicle in real-time.
